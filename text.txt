to create database go to python shell just by entering python to terminal
>>> from app import *
>>> db.create_all()

to add entry to database
>>> from app import *
>>> user1 = User(fullname="Admin123",email="admin@user.com",password="12345",address="Greater Noida",pincode="201310",type="admin")
>>>db.session.add(user1)
>>>db.session.commit() # to reflect to database

to update changes to entry in database we use-
>>>user = User.query.filter_by(username="name in database").first()
>>>user.username = "update name"
>>>user.email = "update email"
>>>db.session.commit()

to delete entry from database -
>>>user = User.query.get(id which we want to delete)
>>>db.session.delete(user)
>>>db.session.commit()

to read entry from database-
>>>users = User.query.all()
>>>users
>>>user1 = users[0]
>>>user1
>>>user1.fullname # entry that you want to retrieve like fullname

NOTE--> from app import *   should be written before starting any operation on database

to come out of the shell-
>>>exit()
